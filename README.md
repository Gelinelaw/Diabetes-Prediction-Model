# Diabetes-Prediction-Model
This project analyzes a dataset from the National Institute of Diabetes and Renal Diagnosis to understand the factors that may lead to diabetes. The analysis focuses on several important measurements:

-Glucose Levels: This refers to the 2-hour plasma glucose concentration measured during an oral glucose tolerance test. High glucose levels can indicate a higher risk of diabetes.

-Blood Pressure: This is the diastolic blood pressure measured in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg). High blood pressure is often associated with various health issues, including diabetes.

-Body Mass Index (BMI): BMI is calculated using a person's weight and height. It helps assess body fat and is commonly used to determine obesity, a risk factor for developing diabetes.

-Age: Age is an important factor, as the likelihood of developing diabetes generally increases as people get older.

-Pregnancies: The number of times a patient has been pregnant can impact diabetes risk, especially for women. This measurement helps understand any potential link between pregnancy and diabetes.

-Skin Thickness: This measurement, taken from the triceps skinfold, is used to assess body fat. Higher skin thickness may indicate a higher level of body fat, which can be linked to diabetes risk.

-Insulin Levels: This measures the amount of insulin in the blood after two hours. Insulin is vital for managing blood sugar levels, and abnormal insulin levels can indicate a risk for diabetes.

-The project uses Logistic Regression and Decision Trees as methods to predict whether individuals in the dataset exhibit signs of diabetes based on the mentioned factors. The goal is to identify which measurements are most strongly associated with the presence of diabetes.

-By analyzing these factors, the project highlights the importance of regular monitoring of glucose levels. Understanding these relationships can assist healthcare providers in making decisions regarding patient care and help individuals become more aware of their health risks. The results aim to provide clear insights that can inform both medical professionals and patients about the factors contributing to diabetes.
